     * Constructor:
     * - `AnyRef()`: Constructs an empty `AnyRef` instance.
     * - `template<typename T> explicit(false) constexpr AnyRef(T &obj) noexcept`: Constructs an `AnyRef` with a
     * reference to the specified object `obj` and stores its type information.
     *
     * Member Functions:
     * - `template<typename T> T &get() const noexcept`: Returns a reference to the stored object of type `T`. The
     * function will assert if the stored object's type does not match `T` or if the `AnyRef` is empty.
     *
     * Usage of such a class can be particularly beneficial in scenarios where type erasure is needed, or when dynamic
