     * @brief FIsSet is a utility class that provides a mechanism for checking if a specific condition is met.
     *
     * This class is designed to perform checks against a given set of criteria, making it useful for validation,
     * constraint checking, and various condition evaluations within an application. It can be extended or composed
     * as needed to fit specific use cases.
     *
     * @details The class encapsulates logic to determine if certain conditions hold true, offering methods
     * to initialize, update, and evaluate these conditions. By abstracting the condition evaluations,
     * it enhances code readability and maintainability, enabling developers to define clear and reusable
     * condition checks.

     * for a clean and readable way to chain multiple optional manipulations and checks in a
     * manner similar to Java's Optional API. This enhances code readability and maintainability
     * by abstracting the complexity of condition evaluations.
