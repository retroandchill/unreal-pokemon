     * floats, and other primitives to their corresponding byte representations. This is
     * useful in scenarios where low-level data manipulation or communication protocols
     * that require data in byte form are involved.
     *
     * Key features:
     * - Cast integers (int, long, etc.) to byte arrays.
     * - Cast floating-point numbers (float, double) to byte arrays.
     * - Ensure proper endianess during the casting process.
     * - Utility methods to handle casting of custom objects, if needed.
