# Aggregate awaiters

These awaiters are in the `UE5Coro` namespace, and allow you to combine multiple
awaitables or TCoroutines into one operation.

The return values of the functions are copyable and allow one concurrent
co_await.
Once the first await completes, further awaits return the same value (except for
WhenAll, which is `void`) synchronously on the calling thread.

The calling coroutine will resume on a thread corresponding to one of the
parameters passed in.
For instance, if all parameters would resume on the game thread when awaited
directly, their aggregate is guaranteed to resume on the game thread, but if one
of them would resume on another thread, then the aggregate might resume on the
game thread or that other thread.

### auto WhenAny(TAwaitable auto&&... Awaitables)
### auto WhenAny(const TArray\<TCoroutine\<\>\>& Coroutines)

These functions `co_await` everything passed in, and resume the calling
coroutine when the first one completes.
The rest are ignored, but they're still in a co_awaited state, which matters for
types that cannot be reused.

Completion includes **un**successful completions.

The result of awaiting the return value of these functions is the index of the
parameter that first completed.
The two overloads behave identically.
In case of zero parameters, a negative value will be returned instantly on the
calling thread (0 would mean the first parameter).

Simple example:
```cpp
using namespace UE5Coro;

int FirstTask = co_await WhenAny(TaskA /*0*/, TaskB /*1*/, TaskC /*2*/);
```

Complex example:
```cpp
using namespace UE5Coro;

auto Awaiter1 = SomeAsyncTask();
auto Awaiter2 = AnotherAsyncTask();
DoSomethingUsefulBeforeAwaiting();
int FirstAwaiter = co_await WhenAny(std::move(Awaiter1), std::move(Awaiter2));
```

### auto Race(TArray\<TCoroutine\<\>\> Coroutines)
### auto Race(TCoroutine\<T\>... Coroutines)

These functions behave similarly to WhenAny, but the first coroutine to complete
will cancel all the others.
Completion includes **un**successful completions.

Parameters may only be TCoroutines, not anything awaitable, since awaiters are
not cancelable.
Both overloads behave identically .

If zero coroutines are racing, Race immediately succeeds and a negative value is
returned from the co_await expression (0 would mean the first coroutine).

Example:
```cpp
using namespace UE5Coro;

int Action = co_await Race(TryAttacking(), TryHiding(), TryJumping());
bool bJumped = (Action == 2);
```

### auto WhenAll(TAwaitable auto&&... Awaitables)
### auto WhenAll(const TArray\<TCoroutine\<\>\>& Coroutines)

These functions co_await everything passed in (consuming awaiters that are not
reusable), and resume the calling coroutine once the last of them completes.

Completion includes **un**successful completions.

In case of zero parameters, the operation succeeds immediately, and the
coroutine continues synchronously on the caller thread.

Example:
```cpp
using namespace UE5Coro;

TArray<TCoroutine<>> Tasks;
for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i)
    Tasks.Add(ExpensiveAsyncCoroutine(i));
DoSomethingUsefulBeforeAwaiting();
co_await WhenAll(Tasks);
```
