/**
 * @struct FPokemonAssetParams
 * @brief Contains parameters used to define specific properties for Pokémon assets, such as Form, Gender, Shiny status,
 * and Shadow status.
 *
 * This structure is utilized to customize and resolve Pokémon asset paths based on specified parameters. It supports
 * specifying the form, gender, shiny, and shadow variations of a Pokémon.
 *
 * The structure can be exposed to Blueprints, allowing game designers to configure these parameters directly within the
 * Unreal Engine editor. The UPROPERTY macros facilitate this integration.
 *
 * @param Form Specifies the form of the Pokémon. This influences the resolved asset path if a specific form is
 * provided.
 * @param Gender Specifies the gender of the Pokémon. This affects the resolved asset path based on gender variations.
 * @param bShiny Determines whether the Pokémon is shiny. Shiny status influences the resolved asset path to include
 * shiny-specific assets.
 * @param bShadow Determines whether the Pokémon is shadow. Shadow status influences the resolved asset path to include
 * shadow-specific assets.
 *
 * @fn CreatePokemonSpriteResolutionList
 * Generates a list of sprite resolutions based on the Pokémon species and specified subfolder. Various factors such as
 * shiny, shadow, gender, and form are considered while creating this list.
 *
 * @param Species The species of the Pokémon. This is the primary identifier used to generate the sprite resolution
 * list.
 * @param Subfolder Specifies the subfolder within the asset directory structure where the sprites are stored.
 *
 * @return TArray<FString> A list of formatted sprite resolution strings based on the provided parameters and subfolder.
